    My time at UAH has been spent studying the in's and out's of cybersecurity and managing teams of cyber professionals. I have been able to strengthen my skills as an engineer, as well as learn what it takes to write policies, educate others on cybersecurity, and what kind of skills a leader in technology needs to have to succeed.

    In this program, I have taken courses on cybersecurity engineering, resource planning, data science and analytics, and management.

    While enrolled at USA, I discovered my passion for creating software to solve problems. I took classes such as Python programming and Client/Server Programming With .NET, and learned the basics of how to create web applications. This program also led me down the path of business, taking courses in management, finance, and economics. 
    
    I also spent some time in Phi Kappa Sigma Fraternity, where I served as VP of Education, creating plans for members to succeed in higher education, as well as the Graphic Design Chair, where I was responsible for various t-shirt and sign designs.
