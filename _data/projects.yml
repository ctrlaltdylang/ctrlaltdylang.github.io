    Combining my love for web development, Dungeons & Dragons, and Pokemon
  description: | 
    I created this project as a way to keep up with the many details of running and playing in a homebrew D&D campaign, specifically the Pokemon 5e homebrew module. 
    
    This was created with <mark>React</mark> on the frontend, and <mark>Firebase</mark> as the backed, as well as hosting. This project was created to test my skills in <mark>React</mark> and <mark>NoSQL</mark>, using <mark>Cloud Firestore</mark>, as well as a way to give back to a fun community.
    
    Galar5e is also a work in progress, so be sure to check back for updates!
