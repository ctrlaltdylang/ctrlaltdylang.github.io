    Combining my love for web development, Dungeons & Dragons, and Pokemon

    I created this project as a way to keep up with the many details of running and playing in a homebrew D&D campaign, specifically the Pokemon 5e homebrew module. 

    This was created with React on the frontend, and Firebase as the backed, as well as hosting. This project was created to test my skills in React and NoSQL, using Cloud Firestore, as well as a way to give back to a fun community.
